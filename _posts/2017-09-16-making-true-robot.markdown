# Seven emotions
- ANGER : temp madness, need to evacuate
- FEAR : irrational, instinct feeling being killed, hurt
- JOY : normal state
- SADNESS : pointlessness of life, not being cared, obstacles in life
- DISGUST : to something that can be harmful but can be avoided
- CONTEMPT : 
- SURPRISE :

# More emotions
- DOUBT
- LOVE

# More than just emotions
- Add **emotions** (otherwise, see North-Koreans...)
- Add **goal in life** (eg: having friends) (otherwise, see Dolarhyde...)
- Add **events** in its life (otherwise, parallel with lonely elderlies...)
